## Introduction & Background

In this project, I work with data from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), analyzing data using statistical analysis methods covered in the Master of Environmental Data Science program’s Environmental Data Science (EDS) 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science course taught by Max Czpanskiy.

Water is a crucial factor for both ecosystems and human use as it is the driving force behind all environmental processes. For this reason, it is important to monitor water quality to estimate the health of ecosystems. One key parameter in water quality assessments is pH level, which measures the acidity or alkalinity content. It has direct effects on the ecosystem as it impacts chemical and biological processes. Change in pH can affect the solubility of nutrients and minerals for organisms, with low pH leading to the release of toxic metals from sediments (Dewangan 2007). Variation in pH does occur naturally, however we are interested in seeing if climate change has had an impact. 

Climate change is a phenomenon that has affected many naturally occurring variables worldwide. Unfortunately, it almost always has negative impacts on the environment (Ebi 2018). As we will continue to change our climate through modern practices, it is important to understand the effects of doing so. Through high amounts of carbon dioxide emission, we are directly increasing the average temperature worldwide (IPCC 2021)  With increased carbon dioxide concentrations, pH decreases and becomes more acidic (David and Busioc 2017). Already, the EPA stated that Southern California has warmed up about three degrees Fahrenheit over the last century with the rest of state close behind. Not only can global warming have a direct effect on the pH level, but it can also lead to more extreme weather events, causing increased flooding. This flooding can result in spikes of sediment, pathogens, and nutrients in the water, which can degrade water quality by promoting harmful algal blooms, increasing disease risk, and disrupting aquatic ecosystems (Johnson 2022). 

For the scope of this project, we will be studying the relationship of pH with time and space in California. Given the knowledge from above, we assume that climate change has had direct and indirect affects leading to a change in pH over time. Spatially, we want to understand if a latitude affects the outcome of pH.

## About the Data

#### Lab Analysis Data

This data from the California Department of Water Resources was found on [Data.ca.gov](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/water-quality-data). This is a large data set with observations beginning in January of 1953 and ending in December of 2024. There are 18 columns with over four million observations. The columns that we are interested in are `parameter`, `sample_date`, `sample_code`, `result`, `latitude`, `station_type`, and `units`.

The variables are defined by the DWR as the following:

-   `parameter`: The chemical analyte or physical parameter that was measured
-   `sample_date`: The date the sample was collected
-   `sample_code`: Unique DWR lab and field data sample code
-   `result`: The measured result of the constituent
-   `latitude`: Latitude (NAD83)
-   `station_type`: General description of sampling site location, i.e., surface water, groundwater, or other
-   `units`: Units of measure for the result

As our dataset is very large, we will need to do some initial filtering in order to run our models.

### Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(patchwork)
library(sjPlot)
library(broom)
```

### Load data

```{r}
lab_water <- read_csv(here("data", "lab_results.csv"))
```

For my analysis, I want to run a linear regression model to see the relationship of `pH` with `sample_date` and `latitude`. Before I can run my model or make any preliminary plots, I need to filter the data down a bit. As of now, it is too large and will most likely cause my R to crash.

We are interested in the relationship of these variables in both groundwater and surface water. So, we want to create two new dataframes called `ground` and `surface` that represent the data respectively. `lab_water` will be filtered down to `ground` and `surface` using the following code:

#### Ground and surface water from our Lab Data

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"


# Filter to groundwater
ground <- lab_water %>% 
  filter(parameter == "pH") %>%                    # Filter for pH
  mutate(sample_date = mdy_hm(sample_date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(sample_date, "%Y"))) %>%  
  filter(station_type == "Groundwater") %>%        # Filter to only groundwater
  filter(longitude < -50) %>%                      # Get rid of longitudinal outliers
  drop_na(sample_date) %>%                             # Drop NAs for our dates
  mutate(ph = as.numeric(result)) %>% 
  filter(ph >= 0 & ph <= 14.0) %>% 
  mutate(lat_bin = cut(latitude, breaks = c(32, 37, 43), 
                            right = FALSE, 
                            labels = c("32-37", "37-43")))




# Filter to surface water
surface <- lab_water %>% 
  filter(parameter == "pH") %>% 
  mutate(sample_date = mdy_hm(sample_date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(sample_date, "%Y"))) %>%
  filter(station_type == "Surface Water") %>% 
  drop_na(sample_date) %>% 
  mutate(ph = as.numeric(result)) %>% 
  filter(ph >= 0 & ph <= 14.0) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(latitude)) %>% 
  mutate(lat_bin = cut(latitude, breaks = c(32, 37, 43), 
                            right = FALSE, 
                            labels = c("32-37", "37-43")))
```

The code above was used to filter our data to `ground` and `surface` observations, but it is also doing more than that. It is filtering our `parameter` to only pH as it is the result that we are interested in. There were also outliers that didn't make sense within our data that needed to be removed. For example, there were longitudinal outliers that represented observations outside of California. It is surprising to see as this data is supposed to only be observations within California. Likewise, there were outliers within our `pH` column outside the bounds of 0 to 14 that were removed. I also mutated a new row `lat_bin` that binned the latitude into a range of 32.0 - 37.0 degrees North and 37.0 - 43.0 degrees North. This binned column will be used to for our analysis. 

### Preliminary Exploration

Now that we have our data filtered to `pH` for ground and surface water, let's take a look at the distribution of our variables. So, let's plot `latitude` and `year` as histograms for both types of water collection. It is important to always plot the data, especially when you have large datasets.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

ground_latitude_hist <- ggplot(ground, aes(x = latitude)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black",
                 fill = "firebrick") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Latitude for Ground Water",
       x = "Latitude",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() 

ground_year_hist <- ggplot(ground, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black",
                 fill = "firebrick") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Year for Ground Water",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() 

ground_latitude_hist + ground_year_hist

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

surface_latitude_hist <- ggplot(surface, aes(latitude)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black",
                 fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Latitude for Surface Water",
       x = "Latitude",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

surface_year_hist <- ggplot(surface, aes(year)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black",
                 fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Year for Surface Water",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()


surface_latitude_hist + surface_year_hist
```

From our histograms, we see that `latitude` has a strong skew to the the right for our `ground` water data. There is a strong unimodal peak centered around 34.0 degrees North. This latitude represents observations taken in Southern California, more specifically around Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside. Having significantly more observations at this latitude is expected as the greater Los Angeles area is densely populated. The histogram containing our `year` variable is approximately normally distributed with a mean around the 1960s. We know from our metadata that there are observations from 2024, but it is good to keep in mind that the bulk of our data is from 60 years ago.

As for our `surface` water data, we see that the `latitude` distribution is different from our `ground` water. This data is bimodal, with peaks of observations around 34.0 and 38.0 degrees North. Like `ground` water, we expect to see a lot of observations within the greater Los Angeles area. The second mode peaks at 38.0 degrees North, but has a good range of data within 37.0 to 40.0 degrees North.

Before moving forward with linear regression, it is important to plot each explanatory variable with the response variable to see if there is a linear relationship. In the case here, we are plotting our response variable `pH` over our explanatory variable `year`. Instead of using `latitude` as the second explanatory variable, we will use the binned version `lat_bin`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# One plot containing both year and latitudinal range
ggplot(ground, aes(x = year, y = ph, colour = lat_bin)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 0.8, aes(linetype = lat_bin), color = "black") +   
  labs(title = "Groundater pH at different latitudes in California over time (years)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "pH")
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# One plot containing both year and latitudinal range
ggplot(surface, aes(x = year, y = ph, colour = lat_bin)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 0.8, aes(linetype = lat_bin), color = "black") +   
  labs(title = "Surface Water pH at different latitudes in California over time (years)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "pH") 
```

**For the groundwater plot**: Visually, looking at the scatterplot it seems like there may be a linear relationship of `year` and `lat_bin` on `ph`. Both best fit lines are slightly positively sloped, indicating a linear relationship. The two lines also look like they have slightly different slopes, indicating that latitude can contribute to different rates of change.

**For the surface water plot**: Like the groundwater plot, there is an indication of a linear relationship between the variables. The best fit lines are again, slightly positively sloped.

As we wouldn't expect to see a huge rate of change in pH over time, as it has logarithmic scaling, a linear regression model looks plausible. Let's continue forward.

### My Hypotheses

- H~o~: There is no change in surface and groundwater pH over time (years) or across latitude in California

- H~a~: There is a change in surface and groundwater pH over time (years) or across latitude in California

## Analysis

The plan for this analysis is to run a multiple linear regression model. We are interested to see if there is a relationship between our response variable `pH` and the two explanatory variables `year` and `lat_bin`. The two equations below represent our model. The first one is the original formula given two explanatory variables. The second one represents said equation with our variables plugged in for X~1~, X~2~, and Y.

$$\large \hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon$$

$$ \large \text{pH} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{year} \ + \beta_2 \cdot \text{lat\_bin} + \epsilon  $$

#### Let's run the models for both the ground and surface dataframes 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

ground_model <- lm(ph ~ year + lat_bin, data = ground)
ground_model %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  tab_model()


```

### Model Interpretation:

#### **Coefficients**

-   `Intercept`: With an intercept coefficient of 1.39, when `year` and `lat_bin37-43` are 0, the estimated value of `ph` is 1.39.

-   `year`: The coefficient is 0.0033, for each increasing `year`, our `ph` increases by 0.0033 when `lat_bin37-43` is 0.

-   `lat_bin37-43`: The coefficient is 0.064, suggesting that observations in `lat_bin37-43` have a estimated `ph` that is 0.064 units higher than the reference category (`lat_bin32_37`).

#### **Significance**

-   The p-values for `year` and `lat_bin37-43` are very small, indicating that they are both statistically significant.

-   Multiple R-squared: The r-squared value of 0.011 is very small, indicating that 1.10% of the variablity in `ph` is explained by `year` and `lat_bin37-43`.

#### **Interpretation**

-   The low R-squared value of 0.011 suggests that the model doesn't explain the variability in our `ph`. This means that there are variables not included in the model that explain the outcome of our pH variable.


## Now let's run a linear regression for our Surface Water

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

surface_model <- summary(lm(ph ~ year + lat_bin, data = surface))
surface_model %>% 
  tab_model()
```

### Model Interpretation

#### **Coefficients**

-   `Intercept`: When both `year` and `lat_bin37-43` are zero, the estimated `ph` is -2.83.
-   `year`: The coefficient is 0.0055, for each increasing year, the estimated value of `ph` increases by 0.0055 when latitude is constant
-   `lat_bin37-43`: The coefficient is -0.087, suggesting that observations in `lat_bin37-43` have a estimated `ph` that is 0.064 units lower than the reference category (`lat_in32-37`). 

#### **Significance**

-   The p-values for all coefficients are very small, indicating that they are all statistically significant.

-   Multiple R-squared: Multiple R-squared: The r-squared value of 0.026 is very small, indicating that 2.60% of the variablity in `ph` is explained by `year` and `latitude`.

#### **Interpretation**

The low R-squared value of 0.026 suggests that the model doesn't explain the variability in our `ph`. Meaning confounding variables are not included in our model which better explain the outcome of ph. 

## Conclusion

From this analysis, we can conclude that there isn't a direct relationship of `year` and `latitude` on the `ph` of ground and surface water. We have statistically significant p-values that suggest there is a relationship between all of our variables, however, small r-squared values contradict this statement. This model has a clear indication of omitted variable bias (OVB). 

In the future, additional research can be done with the same dataset. It would be important to include other variables within the model to better represent how pH changes. These variables include, water temperature, aklalinity, CO2 concetrations, turbidity, and more. It would be interesting to include these variables alongside year and latitude to assess if they still contain small p-values.
